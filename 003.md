There are lots of array transformation, but what to do if you can't find one that fits. -- `reduce()``

Map, filter, reject and find are all list transformations, but they are all specific. `reduce()` is not.

`reduce()` is the multi-tool of list transformations.

You can use `reduce()` to implement others. A "super-list" transformation. You can use `reduce()` to fall back upon if you cannot find a prebuilt list transformation function.

Like `map()` and `filter()`, `reduce()` takes a callback function, **and** it also takes an object. You can think of this object as a starting point.

```JavaScript
var totalAmount = orders.reduce((sum, order) => sum + order.amount, 0);
```
