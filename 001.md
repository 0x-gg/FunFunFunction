##### Higher order functions

in JS & all functional programming languages - Functions are values

Create an anonymous function and assign it to a values

JS - functions can be assigned to variables, or passed into other functions i.e. higher order functions

**composition** - take one function and put it into another function. This allows us to compose a lot of small functions into bigger functions.

**callback functions** - Functions that you send into other functions

Callback functions and filter function slot into each other - they are "composable"

`isDog` made it so easy

| `animals.filter()` | `animals.reject()` | `animals.find()`            |
|:-------------------|:-------------------|:----------------------------|
| accept             | reject             | find first                  |
|                    |                    | transforms into single item |


Divide your code into small simple functions and compose them together using higher order functions.
