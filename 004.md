---

`reduce()` isn't useful only for reducing input to a single number. You can also reduce to an array or an object.

Importing fs from node and

```JavaScript
import fs from 'fs';

var output = fs.readFileSync('data.txt', 'utf8')
.trim()
.split('\n')
.map(line => line.split('\t'))
.reduce((customers, line) => {
  customers[line[0]] = customers[line[0]] || []
  customers[line[0]].push({
    name: line[1],
    price: line[2],
    quantity: line[3]
  })
  return customers;
}, {});

console.log('output', JSON.stringify(output, null, 2));
```

Chaining -

Good functional code is made up of small functions that do one thing and you just bind them all together.

The chainability is something that you will see a lot of when you functional programming.
